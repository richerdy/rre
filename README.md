There are player-operable vehicles in Rust. Boats are used to traverse long distances across water and reach valuable loot.[21] Some airborne vehicles, such as hot air balloons, can also be used to explore the map quickly. Spawning randomly, they can be used once fueled. These player-controlled vehicles, and unlike the offensive AI entities, can be destroyed by surface-to-air missiles that players can position outside bases.[22][23] Similarly, the player can transport themselves and others using modular vehicles found while exploring. Vehicle chassis are situated on roadsides and must be sufficiently repaired and fitted with an engine before use.[24]

Airdrops are an important element in Rust.[25] These are parachute-equipped pallets of supplies delivered by a prop plane. They can be seen over extremely long distances, sometimes resulting in players running toward the airdrop.[19] There are also other entities that drop advanced loot, including an attack helicopter[17] and the CH-47 Chinook.

The correct armour or clothing must be worn to enter these areas; failure to do so can result in death.[10] Upon death, a screen with an option to respawn at a random location or at a sleeping bag or bed (placed prior to death) appears. Respawning resets the player's inventory to the basic rock and torch. Rust is sometimes played in a "clan". Clans usually create housing for their members, give items and supplies to each other and partake in organised raiding and looting.[11][12][13] Player vs player (PvP) combat is accomplished with bows, melee weapons and craftable guns.[14] Bullets and other projectiles travel in a ballistic trajectory, rather than being hitscan.[3][15] There are a number of different types of bullet for each gun, including8 to 10 million players a week[154] and also credited Apex Legends with the company's recent upturn in live services earnings as their Q1 2020 financial results exceeded expectations.[155]
